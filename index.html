                <p>I graduated from <strong>Western Washington University</strong> where I studied <strong>Business Marketing and Management</strong>, was well as <strong>Audio Engineering</strong>. Since graduating I have held a variety of different jobs including production work, sales, and even a few years in Washington’s legal cannabis industry. I decided to get into programming because I feel like it’s a valuable skill to have and could open the doors to more career opportunities. In many ways, I’ve found programming similar to my background in audio engineering. Both strike an even balance between creativity and the use of logic and planning in order to create your end product.</p>
                <p>Outside of work I have a number of hobbies. I currently play in a post-punk band called Dry Wedding here in Portland. I play a multitude of instruments, though I am most fluent in the guitar. I also like to put my education to use and take on various recording projects for other local artists.  Beyond music I like to do a lot of other things that are pretty typical with most people living in the PNW, such as hiking and hanging out at different breweries. </p>

              <p>So far, most of my projects have been for practice and getting familiar with basic coding languages. Because of this, most are going to be bare and incomplete, though you can view them on <a href="https://github.com/gronskan?tab=repositories">my github profile</a>.</p>
              <p>Some examples that stand out include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://gronskan.github.io/Animal-shelter/">This animal shelter hompage</a>, which utilizes some <span class="highlight">CSS</span> styles and atleast has some form of cohesiveness to it.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://gronskan.github.io/vacation-site/">This vacation spot homepage</a> I'll admit is pretty terrible looking, but it utilizes some <span class="highlight">Bootstrap</span> classes, and than uses some <span class="highlight">CSS</span> styles to edit the bootstrap classes.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>So far, all my projects have followed the same basic creative process:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>First I use <span class="highlight">HTML</span> to start with a rough framework to build the project off of.</li>
                  <li>Then I add some content to the <span class="highlight">HTML</span> page, as well as some basic <span class="highlight">CSS</span> styles to help shape the bigger picture.</li>
                  <li>And finally I fine tune each area and add more detailed <span class="highlight">CSS</span> styles as well as some <span class="highlight">Bootstrap</span> classes to help make it stand out.</li>
                </ol>
              <p>Overall, I look forward to creating more projects and expanding on current ones.</p>
